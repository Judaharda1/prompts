INPUT:HISTORY OF CIVIL ENGINEERING

Innovation in civil engineering involves using new ideas and technologies to improve infrastructure. This includes smart infrastructure with real-time monitoring, advanced materials like self-healing concrete, sustainable practices, 3D printing for construction, and Building Information Modeling (BIM) for better project planning. These innovations enhance the efficiency, durability, and sustainability of civil engineering projects. For a fast developing innovation it is important to look back to the past because through the  history of building infrastructure better innovations are created. From the famous pyramid built during BCE to the rapid innovation throughout the history one of which is the Ancient Rome where The Romans were pioneers in civil engineering, developing advanced infrastructure like aqueducts, roads, and bridges. Organizations and individual engineers that helped nurture civil engineerings throughout the generation. Now lets look back to the history of civil engineering where a lot can be learned and possible innovation ideas can be created.


It is difficult to determine the history of emergence and beginning of civil engineering, however, that the history of civil engineering is a mirror of the history of human beings on this earth. Man used the old shelter caves to protect themselves of weather and harsh environment, and used a tree trunk to cross the river, which being the demonstration of ancient age civil engineering.

In ancient Egypt, civil engineers designed and constructed remarkable structures, such as the pyramids and temples. These structures were built to bear the test of time and were made using the materials that were available at the time, such as stone and mud bricks. Civil engineers in ancient Egypt also developed irrigation systems to ensure that the land could be farmed all year round. One of the most famous examples of this is the Nile River irrigation system, which still provides water to farmers in Egypt today.
In ancient Greece, civil engineers developed the concept of the arch, which allowed them to build larger and more stable structures. The Greeks were known for their impressive bridges, which transported water from mountain springs to urban areas. The most famous of these is the Aqueduct of Segovia, which was built by the Romans in Spain.
In ancient Rome, civil engineers built general road networks, aqueducts, and public buildings, such as the Colosseum and the Pantheon. These structures were built using a combination of concrete, stone, and brick, and were designed to be both functional and aesthetically good-looking. The Romans also developed the concept of the arch and the dome, which allowed them to create larger and more complex structures. (Rabbi,2023)


Educational & Institutional history of civil engineering
In the 18th century, the term civil engineering was coined to incorporate all things civilian as opposed to military engineering. The first engineering school, The National School of Bridges and Highways, France, was opened in 1747. The first self-proclaimed civil engineer was John Smeaton who constructed the Eddystone Lighthouse. In 1771, Smeaton and some of his colleagues formed the Smeatonian Society of Civil Engineers, a group of leaders of the profession who met informally over dinner. Though there was evidence of some technical meetings, it was little more than a social society.

The Romans built a sophisticated system of roads to ensure the management of conquered territory. They did so by combining earth, gravel and bricks made of granite or volcanic lava. They ended up building over 50,000 kilometres, and like on modern roads there were signs and signals telling travellers the distance to their destination.
Innovation in the field of transport infrastructure, and specifically roads, leads us to the notion of ‘smart roads': roads that use photosensitive paint for road markings that can be seen regardless of the weather, generating symbols on the road surface, roads that allow energy to be generated, and to be able to recharge batteries while driving a vehicle.(
In many respects, Roman engineering is synonymous for military engineering. Floating bridges (pontoons) were mostly designed and constructed during wartime, and were a speciality of Julius Caesar. In 55 CB he built a 400-metre-long pontoon to cross the river Rhine. The construction of a floating bridge without diverting the flow of the river is very difficult, and it needs to be done quickly and accurately.
With a strained urban transport system, those who live and work in the area are experiencing longer commute times due to traffic congestion. Clogged roads and heavy traffic cause millions in economic losses daily and affect the quality of life of those in the community as they struggle to get around the city. To address the growing traffic congestion in and around the city, Cebu Cordova Link Expressway Corporation proposed the construction of a third bridge. The project, Cebu-Cordova Link Expressway (CCLEX), is an 8.5-kilometer bridge that will connect the island of Mactan in the municipality of Cordova to mainland Cebu. With a daily capacity of 50,000 vehicles, it will serve as an alternate route to and from the Mactan Cebu International Airport and reduce the travel time by approximately 40 minutes.

3 I.L.O. (Intended learning outcomes) definition/scope/subspecialization 




1.	Institution of Civil Engineers (ICE): Founded in 1818, ICE is one of the world’s oldest professional engineering institutions. It supports civil engineers and technicians by providing professional qualifications, training, and development opportunities. ICE also promotes the importance of civil engineering to society.
2.	American Concrete Institute (ACI): ACI is a leading authority and resource worldwide for the development and distribution of consensus-based standards, technical resources, educational programs, and certification programs related to concrete design, construction, and materials.
3.	Structural Engineering Institute (SEI): Part of ASCE, SEI advances the practice of structural engineering by providing resources for professional development, technical standards, and networking opportunities.
4.	International Federation of Consulting Engineers (FIDIC): FIDIC represents the global consulting engineering industry. It provides best practice guidelines, training, and advocacy to support the development of civil engineers worldwide.
5.	Philippine Institute of Civil Engineers (PICE): PICE is the national organization of civil engineers in the Philippines. It offers professional development, networking opportunities, and advocacy for the civil engineering profession in the country.
These organizations offer a variety of resources, including publications, conferences, training programs, and networking opportunities, all aimed at supporting the growth and development of civil engineers.

It was not until the 18th century that the term “civil engineering” was coined. The first civil engineering school was opened in 1747 in France. It was called The National School of Bridges and Highways. The first self-proclaimed civil engineer was a man named John Smeaton. Smeaton would eventually form the Smeatonian Society of Civil Engineers, who acted as leaders in the profession. And although this was more a social society than a technical group, the networking, and conversation that took place there influenced the design and construction of more than a few buildings of the 18th century.
It was not until 1818 in London that the world’s first engineering society was set up as the Institution of Civil Engineers. It was in 1828 that the Institution of Civil Engineers received a Royal Charter and formally recognized civil engineering as a profession. 
John Smeaton, the first man to call himself a civil engineer, began as an instrument maker. His design of Eddystone Lighthouse (1756–59), with its interlocking masonry, was based on a craftsman’s experience. Smeaton’s work was backed by thorough research, and his services were much in demand. In 1771 he founded the Society of Civil Engineers (now known as the Smeatonian Society). Its object was to bring together experienced engineers, entrepreneurs, and lawyers to promote the building of large public works, such as canals (and later railways), and to secure the parliamentary powers necessary to execute their schemes.

In the late 1920s, group of civil engineers from the government sector formed the Philippine Society of Civil Engineers (PSCE) which was the first civil engineering organization in the Philippines with Engr. Marcial Kasilag as its first president.
In 1937, the Philippine Association of Civil Engineers (PACE) was formed. This time, it was a group of civil engineers in the private sector with Engr. Enrique Sto. Tomas Cortes as its first president.
The objectives of both organizations were similar with each other in which both of them wants to: "elevate the standards of the profession, encourage research and engineering knowledge and technology, foster fellowship among members, and promote interrelation with other technological and scientific societies".


Intended Learning Outcomes (ILOs) are clear, concise statements that describe what students are expected to know, understand, and be able to do by the end of a course or program. They focus on measurable and observable outcomes, emphasizing the results of learning rather than the process. ILOs are used at various levels of education, including institutional, program, and course levels. At the institutional level, they align with the overall mission and goals of the institution. At the program level, they define what students should achieve by the end of a particular program, and at the course level, they focus on specific accomplishments by the end of a course or module. ILOs can be categorized into different domains of learning, such as the cognitive domain (knowledge and intellectual skills), the affective domain (attitudes, values, and feelings), and the psychomotor domain (physical skills and actions).
